## Playing the Game:
The aim of the game in chinese checkers is to select a (red) peg on the board and jump over another (red) peg to land on an empty spot. When doing this the peg you jumped over will be removed from the board.
You need to play the game in such a way that only one peg remains on the board at the end. Depending on the difficulty you had chosen this can be either (only) in the middle of the board or anywhere on the board.
Also depending on the difficulty you had chosen you can either jump horizontally and vertically over pegs or diagonally as well.

### Music
It is unknown who created the music. 
All i know is it originated from a midi file named "chineOPL.mid" which was downloaded somewhere during the 1990's but google yields no results and shazam or soundhound don't recognize it.
If you happen to recognize it please let me know so i can give proper credit
